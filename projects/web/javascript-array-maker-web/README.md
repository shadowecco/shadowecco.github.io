# Javascript Array Maker

This was inspired when I was creating my fantasy name generator project.

[Fantasy Name Generator (Github Code)](https://github.com/shadowecco/shadowecco.github.io/tree/main/projects/web/fantasy-name-generator-web)

The names used in the project was in a notepad document and it was difficult for the code to read from a text file using vanilla Javascript. In the end, I deicded to use an array for each text file. As there were so many entries in each text file, I created this array maker to make it easier to convert into array format.

Initally created using:

- HTML
- CSS
- Jquery
