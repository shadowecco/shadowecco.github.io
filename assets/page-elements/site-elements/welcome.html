        I am an ambitious and determined person. I have been attracted to computing since I was 7. During my life, I have adapted to changes and tried to learn new technologies by myself. Before starting the Re-start course, I used Microsoft office a lot, especially Microsoft Front Page to create my own webpages. During my time on a Media and Communication Studies course in college, I created simulations of advertising campaigns and magazines using programs such as Photoshop and QuarkXpress. In recent years, I have found a passion for formatting and editing ebooks through a program called Calibre book editor. This is where I learned to use CSS coding for the first time. What interested me was the idea of being able to use coding to create and modify templates. As this is an important feature in cloud computing, I feel I may have found my niche

        I have learned many new skills on the Re-start course, including how to use Linux and AWS services through Putty, the Management Console as well as the AWS Command Line. Other aspects include using Python, learning networking, security and how to use Databases using SQL language. Overall, I have really enjoyed participating in the course because it created positive challenges for me to accomplish. What I really enjoyed was completing the labs via Vocareum. These labs simulated situations and made the class learning relevant to real-life issues in the cloud computing world. I enjoyed learning Python coding because it gave me a chance to create functions and programs. Since completing the Python course, I have read books and studied forums to further enhance my learning so I can create more detailed projects than I was taught in the course. During my time on the course, I discovered extra learning on freecodecamp.org which is a free online learning platform. Currently, I have achieved certifications in Responsive Web Design and Scientific Computing with Python, putting more than 100 hours in this learning.

        In my life, I worked at Primark for over four years, learning and utilising extensive customer service skills as well as adjusting to customer's needs and expectations. In my current job at Amazon, while I’m not face-to-face with the customer, I have to meet quality standards that meets customer expectations. Because of this, I am able to display extensive Interpersonal Communication skills. It had also taught me to learn working as part of a team. I am also a very strong independent worker who is very methodical in my working, focusing on one task at a time so it can be dome more efficiently. In part with problem solving, I show perseverance and determination. I prefer to go on an independent route checking troubleshooting guides and solutions via Google before I ask peers for help.

        </br></br>

        The Re-Start course has made me realised that I’d like to become a programmer or a developer. Coding has allowed me to create new things and solve problems. In the short future, while working as a developer I am planning to achieve the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification and after that progress with the AWS Developer Associated Certification and keep improving my coding skills and my cloud knowledge.</p>
